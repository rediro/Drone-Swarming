# Drone-Swarming


Conducted research and development on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) swarming technology, focusing on swarm control and communication architectures. Explored centralized, decentralized, and hybrid control methods for UAV coordination, utilizing FANET-based and mesh ad-hoc network architectures to enhance UAV-to-UAV communication. Developed test beds using custom UAVs with integrated MAVLink communication protocols and real-time data exchange capabilities. Proposed future enhancements, including the integration of machine learning for object detection and 360-degree lidar for obstacle avoidance. Reported findings and provided directions for advancing autonomous UAV swarming technology in commercial applicationsâ€‹[(UAV_Swarming_Report](https://github.com/rediro/Drone-Swarming/blob/main/UAV_Swarming_Report%20(1).pdf)).
